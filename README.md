# w_ipython

This is the staging area for a new interactive [WESTPA](https://github.com/westpa) tool, w_ipython (name subject to change).

## INSTALLATION ##

Clone the repo, then load the WESTPA module OR specify $WEST_ROOT.
The setup file assumes you can write into that directory.

You can then run it via w_ipython

If that doesn't work:
chmod +x w_ipython

Copy w_ipython somewhere within your path, then modify it such that it points to the location of w_ipython.py

You'll need to modify your west.cfg and add the w_ipython section (making changes for your analysis scheme, of course).

Cheers!
