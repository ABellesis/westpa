{"name":"WESTPA","tagline":"The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis","body":"### What is WESTPA?\r\nWESTPA is an open-source software package that provides a high-performance framework for carrying out extended-timescale simulations of rare events with rigorous kinetics using the weighted ensemble algorithm of [Huber and Kim (1996)](http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495%2896%2979552-8). The software also includes (1) options for further enhancing the sampling efficiency through reassignment of weights according to either [equilibrium](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct401065r) or [nonequilibrium steady state ](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/133/1/10.1063/1.3456985), and (2) a plugin for using a [weighted ensemble-based string method](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/138/4/10.1063/1.4773892). \r\n\r\n**Key features of the software:**   \r\n* **Linear scaling.** Nearly perfect scaling up to thousands of cores.  \r\n* **Flexible.** Designed to conveniently interface with any stochastic sampling engine, including but not limited to molecular dynamics (e.g. AMBER, GROMACS, and NAMD) and Monte Carlo codes.  \r\n* **Portable.** The software can be used with any Unix operating system (e.g. Linux or OS X).  \r\n* **Free and open source.** All source code is available under the GNU GPL license.  \r\n\r\n**Please cite the following for use of WESTPA:**\r\n \r\nMC Zwier, JL Adelman, JW Kaus, AJ Pratt, KF Wong, NB Rego, E Suárez, S Lettieri, DW Wang, M Grabe, DM Zuckerman, and LT Chong. “WESTPA: An interoperable, highly scalable software package for weighted ensemble simulation and analysis”. _J.
